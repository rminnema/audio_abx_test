# Audio ABX Test

## Introduction

Audio ABX Test is a utility intended for users to perform A/B/X testing of audio files in their music library. The comparison is done between the high quality original files in the user's library versus a lower quality encoding of the same file. The utility is designed to provide a testing environment that disallows cheating and provides feedback to the user on their guesses. Audio ABX Test may also be used to generate clips at arbitrary positions within songs, either randomly or by user selection.
